1. Buisness component is application, program are kept seperated at different layer/tier so they are isolated from programming, server part.

2. It's modular design means the program we write in Java EE is classified in many small modules so according to change in buisness logic we can change program easily
without any interferance with code.

3. Java EE provides security for business applications because as I wrote in point 1, the business logic is kept seperated form actual programming logic.
In short business layer and web application layer are kept seperated from each other.
