What are Distributed Applications:
1.  The Applications which can be run across different machines at a same time using Internet.
2.  One Machine acts as a server where the application is deployed and other machine acts a client.
3.  e.g:



client1       client2                         
      |       |
      server1  ---------------------------
      |       |                          |
client1       client2                    |
                                         | 
                                         |
                                         |
                                         |

                                         |_____________________________>      Internet  (It means that many clients are connected to different servers and 
client1       client2                    |                             >                  these servers are connected usign Internet with each other.)
